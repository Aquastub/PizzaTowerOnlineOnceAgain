# Pizza Tower ONLINE
The entire Pizza Tower Online source code prior to its inevitable demise, left in a very unstable state between the April build and Eggplant build port process.
This uses the leaked Western v3 source code of the game as a base. Ops! Sorry!

The online part of this game uses [GameMaker Server](https://gamemakerserver.com/), a free extension that I used for years. It's honestly horrible for making any actual gameplay, and it'll be deprecated soon anyway. I recommend you to just remove it completely.

P.S. Contributors are not the same as collaborators. It shows MLGKuba11 in the contributors because they once made a commit for this when we all had a truce. The only way to remove this would be to make a completely new repository losing all commit history, which I'm not doing. **Please understand, and don't go harassing them.**
