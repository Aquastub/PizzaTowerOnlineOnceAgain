# PizzaTowerOnline
the entire pizza tower online source code.
this uses the leaked western v3 source code of pizza tower, so most of the vanilla code looks horrendous.

if you're gonna clone this at least change the game id in the gamemaker server code.
if you're stuck at the disclaimer change the version number in its create event to 6.

contributors are not the same as collaborators. it shows MLGKuba11 in the contributors because they once made a commit for this.
