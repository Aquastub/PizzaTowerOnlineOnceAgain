# PizzaTowerOnline
the entire pizza tower online source code, prior to its inevitable demise, left in a very unstable state between the april build and eggplant build port process.
this uses the leaked western v3 source code of pizza tower as a base, so some of the vanilla code looks horrendous.

the online part of this game uses gamemaker server, a free extension that i used for years. it's honestly horrible for making any actual gameplay, and it'll be deprecated sooner or later anyway. i recommend you not to touch that part of it, in fact it would be better to just remove it completely.
if you're stuck at the disclaimer change the version number in its create event to 10.

contributors are not the same as collaborators. it shows MLGKuba11 in the contributors because they once made a commit for this. the only way to remove this would be to make a completely new repository losing all commit history.
